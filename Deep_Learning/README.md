# Deep Learning

The files in this folder are my attempt at training a model with deep learning

## File Structure

Yes, this needs to be in its own folder instead of the `Anomaly_Detection` folder, due to the core structure of the project. Ideally this would not be the case, but completely refactoring the project at this point is simply not worth it.

### fdom

This folder contains the fdom model trainer.

### turb

This folder contaisn the turb model trainer
